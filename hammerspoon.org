* The Problem
- The mouse is slow, inaccurate, and prone to human error.
- The keyboard is deterministic and repeatable.
- The keyboard can't control your windows.
* Existing Solutions
- Spotlight
- Alfred
- Quicksilver
- AppleScript
- Divvy
- Witch
- Slate
- Keyboard Maestro
- *HAMMERSPOON*
* Your Hands and Your Keyboard
- Hands naturally rest on the home-keys.
- Modifier keys are annoying to hit, and create unwanted stress.
- IT'S 2017, CAPS LOCK IS OUTDATED AND ANNOYING.
- We want to be as efficient as possible, so why keep this useless key around?
** Hyper-ify Your CAPS
   To achieve our goal, we will be remapping our Caps Lock.

   Depending on your operating system and version there are several different options:
   - Sierra: Karabiner-Elements
   - El Cap and lower: Seil + Karabiner
   - Linux: xmodmap + i3
   
   Simply remap CAPS to all of the available modifier keys, referred to as Hyper.

   Linux has a modifier key called Hyper already :)
* How to Leverage Hyper
Now that you have an easy to access modifier key, let's leverage it.

Things you can do with your shiny new modifier key:
- Open/focus specific applications.
- Resizing windows.
- Change window layout.
- Move windows between monitors.
- Menu automation.
- Workflow automation.
- Escape key!
** Hyper AND Escape
   - Another major efficiency killer on QWERTY keyboards is the ESC key.
   - ESC is extremely inconvient to hit, however we can fix that!
   - Map Caps to work as a modifier when held, and ESC when tapped.
     - There are many different ways of doing this, OS dependant of course.
* Hammerspoon, Hyper, and YOU
Now that we have our Hyper key, and some ideas as to what we want to hotkey, we can start scripting!

A great resource for basic Hammerspoon setup can be found [[https://github.com/lodestone/hyper-hacks][here]]. 

This is the base config that I have extended for my own use.
