* Schema.rb
- The biggest contributor to merge conflicts in any Rails app.
- Things to consider:
  - Timestamp definition
    - This line will be where the vast majority of your conflicts emerge from,
      ensure that the timestamp is the newer of the conflicting values and continue.
  - Index names, make sure that your local database has the same index names as the `schema.rb` file.
** Small Details
 - Remove all `pry` statements.
 - Remove all debug level logger calls
 - Remove any non-standard testing seeds
* Just Git Things
- For those of you that use RubyMine, embrace their merge tool, it is amazing.
- Make sure that your repo is configured to ignore whitespace.
- Learn to love cherry-pick, [[http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/rebase-from-the-ground-up/cherry-picking-explained.html][guide]].
- Keep your local branches clean, [[http://stevenharman.net/git-clean-delete-already-merged-branches][guide]]
** Oddities
 - Things like `cache version` will generally create some kind of merge conflict, in general
   take the newest timestamp.
 - Use a system-wide `.gitignore` to ensure that macOS specific files like .DS_Store aren't committed.
 - If your local branch is _really_ dirty, stash your changes, reset head hard, and try again.
